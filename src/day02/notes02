Folder: Contains files and folders
      create folder(package) in java:  right click src folder
         Mac: right click - new - package

Instalation of JAva
Intelije Idea
JDK 8
open terminal (Mac only):
      search -> type "terminal" + Enter
open command prompt (window only):
      in search bar Type "command prompt" + Enter
short cuts:
   windows:
      copy: ctrl + c
      paste: ctrl + v
   Mac:
      copy: command + C
      paste: command + v
class: where we write our codes
main method: runs the codes as java application
      public static void main(String[] args) {  }
IdeaProject folder: It has all the project that we have created in IntelliJ
   how to find it:
      windows:
         This PC -> C -> users -> YourName -> IdeaProject
      Mac:
         go to Finder -> search for "IdeaProject"
print statement: prints the output to the console
      System.out.println();
how to rename in intellij:
      right click -> refactor -> Rename -> give the new name
Comment: extra notes between codes.
         It doesnt effect actual code
   single-line comment:   starts with //
            // comment1
   multi-line comment:  starts with /* and ends with */
            /*
            comment1
            comment2
            comment3
            */
escape sequences:
    \t: paragraph space
    \n: new line
    \": prints double quote " on the console
    \\: prints \ on the console
    \': prints single quote
    ' : prints single quote
    //        Primitive Data Types
     //        A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.
     //
     //                There are eight primitive data types in Java:
     //
     //        Data Type           Size           Description
     //        byte                1 byte         Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
     //        short            2 bytes            Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
     //        int             4 bytes            Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
     //        long                8 bytes            Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
     //        float           4 bytes            Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
     //        double          8 bytes            Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
     //        boolean         1 bit          Stores true or false values
     //        char                2 bytes            Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values   'a'
primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
   for numbers: byte, short, int, long, float, double
      whole number: byte, short, int, long
      decimal number: float, double
      range:
            double > float > long > int > short > byte
            larger one cannot be assigned to smaller one
            smaller one can be assigned to larger one
As a default java picks int for whole number
As a default java picks double for decimal number
Non primitive types: String, Object
There are also reference types that wrap the primitive types.
These can be useful if you need a make a variable null or use it in a class that requires a non-primitive type
Non primitives are usually objects that we create (the exception being String)
